  "abstract": "<p>Eclipse Xtend is an emerging, object oriented language on the JVM that encourages functional programming and comes with state of the art IDE support for Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA. This session is going to show how Xtend is applied in 10 practical use cases. We will focus on common Java idioms and the integration with popular Java APIs like Android, JavaFX and more.</p>\n<p>You will see how literally any given Java library is even easier to be used and consumed from Xtend than from Java itself. That\u2019s what we call Java-Interop! Xtend code is more concise and readable due to greatly improved signal to noise ratio. Even the simplest tasks become a breeze and powerful language features like the superior annotation processing infrastructure help to automate repetitive coding styles. At the same time all language features are carefully designed to leverage known Java concepts. Java developers get productive in a couple of hours. Xtend will not force you into an entirely new ecosystem but complements Java and allows to stick to all your beloved libraries and tools.</p>\n<p>Join this session and learn how to write cleaner code against any Java APIs and how to solve day-to-day challenges in much better ways.</p>",

Extensibility is internally achieved by using OSGi services. Even though Sling was initially designed for JSR-283 content repositories, building on top of the OSGi service registry allows plugging in multiple data sources - resource providers in Sling parlance.</p>\n<p>In this talk we will showcase the usage of OSGi extension points in Apache Sling which allows usage of multiple resource providers, from simple filesystem-based providers to complex ones like MongoDB or Cassandra.

  "abstract": "<p>Asynchronous and event-driven programming models are great for processing data, whether it's sensors in homes, or metrics from a web server farm, event streaming is a tool for analyzing data that can be produced at any time.</p>\n<p>Whilst Java 8 Streams have begun to teach developers about streaming, it's still stuck with a pull model. How do you cope with push-based events without blocking and timeouts? Rx Java Observables, and the Actor pattern provide a different abstraction, but wouldn't it be great to keep the simplicity of Streams with the power of asynchronous push-based events?</p>\n<p>This talk will describe the prototyping work happening in OSGi's Distributed Eventing RFC, using streams and promises to build event processing pipelines.</p>\n<p>The OSGi service platform has existed as a modular micro-service runtime for well over a decade, but more recently it has embraced asynchronous programming as a core part of the OSGi toolkit. With the introduction of the Async Service, and OSGi promises it is now easier than ever to build asynchronous applications. The focus so far has been on asynchronous requests, but what about streaming systems, ones that need to process or filter thousands,  millions, or billions of events before an answer is reached, or perhaps there is no end to the stream at all!</p>\n<p>Processing distributed events is the purpose of the Distributed Eventing RFC being discussed by the OSGi Enterprise Expert Group. As the lead author of the RFC, and the lead of the Asynchronous Service specification, Tim has a detailed understanding of the complexities of Asynchronous programming models. Tim will be able to describe the current prototyping around OSGi's Asynchronous Streaming model, and how it fits with the other popular asynchronous standards.</p>",

  "abstract": "<p>Graphical editors are a popular means to visualize concepts and architectures through the design of a diagram. More and more solutions follow this approach, among them Papyrus, Sirius, or Capella. However, for diagrams to be useful, their elements have to be carefully positioned. Only then do they convey their intended meaning quickly and accurately.</p>\n<p>While critical, positioning the elements manually is a very time-consuming and complex task that involves systematic compliance with the syntactical constraints of the diagram. The <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/elk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eclipse Layout Kernel (ELK)</a> project aims to free the user from this burden by providing highly customizable and sophisticated layout features.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>\n<p>ELK relies on a robust data structure to represent graphs and annotate them with layout configuration information. It provides an infrastructure to connect automatic layout algorithms to Eclipse-based graphical editors.

  "title": "Because you can't fix what you don't know is broken - How automated error reporting minimizes bug fix cycles and boosts your product quality",
  "abstract": "<p>It's a well-known fact that fixing bugs is 25x cheaper during the development of a software product than fixing them after the product was shipped to your customers [1]. This is in particular true for platforms like Eclipse with an estimated user base of more that 10.000.000 Java, C/C++, PHP, JavaScript users working with it every day.</p>\n<p>Given these numbers it is obvious why detecting bugs as early as possible in the development process is key to every quality assurance team. Teams often rely on a 'ship early, ship often' strategy to learn where their software breaks 'in the field'. But while it is easy to spot problems in a web app, it is many times harder to spot issues if your app runs on a client's desktop or mobile device. The key problem here is that your users only rarely report back all problems they experience. They usually just uninstall the software and disappear with bad feelings about your product...</p>\n<p>Quality is a governing concern for Eclipse Committers as well. Thus, Eclipse Mars introduced an Automated Error Reporting for the Eclipse IDE to provide committers with the necessary feedback where their code breaks, gives committers various means to get in touch with their users, semi-automatically gathers information like runtime configurations and the like \u2013 and thus helps committers to improve the IDE on their way to the next release.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce you to the benefits of automated error reporting based on 9 months of experiences with Eclipse Luna and Mars. It will provide insights into bug fixing rates, number of incoming error reports, user acceptance and critiques, and will shed some light on common coding problems and troubling areas in the Eclipse landscape. Finally, the talk will outline how to integrate automated error reporting into your own applications, may it be an Eclipse RCP based app or any arbitrary Java application.</p>\n<p>No matter how small your app is. Make sure you know when it breaks.</p>\n<p>[1] The Economic Impacts of Inadequate Infrastructure for Software Testing, National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology, <a href=\"http://www.nist.gov/director/planning/upload/report02-3.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nist.gov/director/planning/upload/report02-3.pdf</a></p>",

Through a series of easily adaptable tips and best practices, we will show you how the Xtext team supercharged its contribution process.\n</p>\n<p>Your project needs a lot to succeed:</p>\n<ul><li>It must be easily accessible and highly visible to the outside world, especially to get feedback.</li>\n<li>The developer setup must be streamlined to give potential contributors a jumpstart.</li>\n<li>The build system should be simple to use, so developers can test their contributions before submitting them.</li>\n<li>The contribution process must be as painless as possible for the contributor and obviously for the reviewers and committers too.</li>\n</ul><p>To be honest, just a year ago Xtext was lacking in all of these areas. Although the source code was mirrored to Github, the primary repository wasn\u2019t easily accessible at all. The lack of even a basic readme meant that potential contributors wouldn\u2019t find a single clue. The developer setup was a painful manual process, documented in lengthy, outdated, and deeply buried wiki pages (aka, the place where information goes to die). Even the simplest documentation fixes required a multitude of manual steps and it was almost impossible to ensure everything was put into the right place.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to today - and Xtext uses Github as the primary repository. Contributors can use the well-known Pull Request workflow to contribute changes. Jenkins test jobs can be started by just commenting on a Pull Request. An Oomph setup creates the development workspace in a few simple clicks. The documentation can even be edited online and is automatically synchronized to the website in seconds. Best of all, your project can use these techniques today!</p>",

The companion technologies required to put this in action are small dedicated components (all open-source) at a \"proof of concept\" maturity level extending proven components : <a href=\"https://eclipse.org/sirius/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sirius</a>, Eclipse <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/debug/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug</a>, <a href=\"https://eclipse.org/xtend/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xtend</a> making such features within the reach of Eclipse based tooling. The general intent regarding those OSS technologies is to leverage them within different contexts and contribute them to Eclipse once proven strong enough. The method covers a large spectrum of use cases from DSLs with a straightforward execution semantic to a combination of different DSLs with concurrent execution semantic. Any tool provider can leverage both the technologies and the method to provide an executable DSL and animated graphical modelers to its users enabling simulation and debugging at an early phase of the design.</p>\n<p>This talk presents the approach, the technologies and demonstrate it through an example: providing Eclipse Debug integration and diagram animation capabilities for <a href=\"https://github.com/mbats/arduino\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arduino Designer</a> (EPL) : setting breakpoints, stepping forward or backward in the execution, inspecting the variables states...

The first system was based on a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) as a RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) in the substation and a commercially available SCADA in the remote monitoring and controlling center. The second system had a custom controller as a RTU and a custom build SCADA System. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both systems are used to show and record the required process parameters like:</p>\n<ul><li>current, voltage and power measurements;</li>\n<li>control the states of the circuit breakers for each lead in the substation;</li>\n<li>keep a log of events that have happened in the system.</li>\n</ul><p dir=\"ltr\">The goal of the systems is to enable a better overview of the current state of a part from the electrical power distribution network for the workers in the substation and the remote center .</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Seeing the technology going forward in the last couple of years made me think about if there is a way to improve the infrastructure, reliability and the maintenance processes. That was the basis of the research conducted as a part of my master thesis in the field of Intelligent Information Systems - combining various Eclipse IoT technologies to build an electrical substation automation system.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The goal of this talk is to give an overview how we implemented the electrical substation automation systems 10 years ago, to show how a better and more efficient system can be build by combining various Eclipse IoT technologies like Kura, Eclipse SCADA and Eclipse Smart Home and to discuss the benefits and the improvements of the proposed solution. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The old system will be rebuild in such a way that:</p>\n<ul><li>Eclipse Kura runs as a RTU in the electrical substation;</li>\n<li>Eclipse SCADA is used as a central point for monitoring and controlling the system;</li>\n<li>and optionally Eclipse Smart Home as \u00a0a platform to monitor the power consumption and behaviour of the end users in order to avoid network overloading and power outages.</li>\n</ul><p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In my talk I will talk about:</p>\n<ol><li>Smart Grids;</li>\n<li>Electrical Substations;</li>\n<li>give a short overview of a general structure of an industrial automation control system;</li>\n<li>give a short overview of a general structure of an industrial automation control system;</li>\n<li>discuss what can be monitored and controlled in an electrical substation;</li>\n<li>give an overview of the control system from 10 years ago;</li>\n<li>give an overview of the system with Eclipse IoT: Kura, Eclipse SCADA, Eclipse Smart Home and show how the components in the \u201cclassical\u201d industrial automation systems can be replaced with these modern technologies;</li>\n<li>discuss the benefits and improvements in the newer solution;</li>\n<li>show a demonstration;</li>\n<li>discuss the possible improvements.</li>\n</ol><p dir=\"ltr\">As a proof that this concept will work, a demonstration system will be build and will be presented.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All the source code will be made available on my github account: <a href=\"https://github.com/chombium\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/chombium</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project progress and the phases of development will be published on my blog: <a href=\"https://chombium.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://chombium.wordpress.com/</a></p>",

  "abstract": "<p>Software systems are complex, intangible structures, which are hard to understand. Therefore, visualization of software properties, structure and dependencies in different views play an important role within the lifecycle of a software system. I started to work with software visualization technologies and especially with 3d visualization during my masters thesis at the NICTA in Sydney 2012. The result of the thesis is a tool for 3D visualization of software structures and dependencies that can be integrated in the software development process.</p>\n<p>A few month after the thesis I started to work as a software-engineer for the Payback GmbH and started to integrate the tool into their software development process. This revealed one of the most common issues of software visualization platforms. Which data should be used to create the visualization? Who are the experts on code analysis? So I started to analyze current platforms for software quality analysis and found SonarQube. The platform is wide spread in the industry and I started to rewrite my tool from a visualization platform to a SonarQube plugin. Now, all analysis results (metrics) can be used for the visualization.  </p>\n<p>The SoftVis3D plugin provides two different views. The \"Code city\" is a visualization for the hierarchical structure of the project. It is based on the city metaphor where classes are depicted as buildings and packages as districts. This kind of visualization will help all stakeholders to get an common understanding of the system. The most common use case is the risk analysis. For instance, use the complexity of the class as metric for the building footprint and the number of lines as building height, then you can see you high risk classes as big skyscrapers.</p>\n<p>The dependency view is focussed on the dependencies within the given software project. It was necessary to do a hierarchical transformation of the input dependencies and to alter the 3D visualization to be able to create an understandable representation. The plugin now presents a new concept of the visualization of dependencies, uncovering the real architecture of the system.</p>\n<p>This session will be structured in 3 parts:<br />\n- Why and how to integrate SonarQube in the software development process<br />\n- City code metaphor (explanation and demo)<br />\n- Dependency view (explanation and demo)</p>",

So why is it such a challenge to go from \"connected\" to \"smart\"?

We will demo all the latest enhancements in the tools including features like much smarter property file editing. We will also demonstrate new features in the Eclipse 4.5 (Mars) platform. Going beyond basic application development we will look at how to build and work with systems composed of individual Spring applications that represent microservices. How to easily exploit Spring Cloud to address some common infrastructure issues that come up with this architecture, and we\u2019ll show how to deploy these applications both locally and then remotely to Cloud Foundry, all from Eclipse. We\u2019ll show off the new features of the Cloud Foundry Eclipse plugin including better support for Spring Boot apps, improved performance and full remote debugging for apps running on CF from your desktop Eclipse. For more rapid development of your cloud native applications in a \u2018Cloud Foundry like\u2019 environment on your local machine we will demonstrate deploying to Lattice from STS.

With Eclipse Concierge, a minimal footprint implementation of the OSGi R5 core standard programmers and operators can now benefit from the same modular software development on various embedded devices as they already use on desktop machines and servers. Together with small and efficient implementations of remote services and remote management of the OSGi runtime, building distributed IoT applications becomes a piece of Pi.</p>",

  "title": "EMFForms goes AngularJS",
  "abstract": "<p>EMFForms is a framework to ease the development of form-based UIs. It is one of the most active and well-received projects in the Eclipse community. EMFForms provides a simple language to define the forms of an application in a declarative way. Rendering the forms with a defined UI technology is thereby separated from their definition. A renderer is responsible for producing an actual UI from a form definition. EMFForms ships with excellent tooling to create forms and with industrial-strength renderers for SWT and RAP. There are also incubator implementations for rendering forms based on JavaFX, iOS, Android and Vaadin.<br />\nSince more and more applications are now implemented on a native web stack (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript) in contrast to RAP and Vaadin, EMFForms now also supports rendering forms with AngularJS.<br />\nIn this talk we will provide an introduction to the basics of EMFForms and the concept of UI modeling. We will then demonstrate how this can be used in the context of an AngularJS-based web application using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, JSON and JSON Schema.</p>",

Xbase is statically typed and supports full type checking and type inference. It comes with a compiler and interpreter and integrates seamlessly with all existing Java APIs - it does so even better than Java itself!</p>\n<p>Join this hands-on lab and you will learn about the possibilities that come with Xbase. In only 3 hours, you will develop a full-blown language live and from scratch!

Will I be tied to desktop or will I be ready for the web and mobile? At what degree of integration?</p>\n<p>EMF Parsley was created for addressing these questions: it provides a set of reusable UI components (trees, tables, forms, editors), which are completely customizable, and an Xtext/Xbase based DSL editor for defining/customizing the UI components, which then can be used by your application with few lines of code.</p>\n<p>Here are its main core features:</p>\n<p>- lightweight (it just leverages EMF.Edit layer, XText for the DSL and little more)<br />\n- out-of-the-box integration with XMI, Teneo and CDO persistence implementations<br />\n- usage of Dependency Injection (via Google Juice) instead of Extension Point mechanism<br />\n- an Eclipse/JDT integrated DSL with rich tooling with static type system<br />\n- generation-code oriented (debuggable) instead of reflective approach<br />\n- can be added to existing projects with minimum impact</p>\n<p>Thus, with respect to existing similar frameworks, we aim at static type system checks (avoiding runtime errors typical of reflective approaches) and we make it easy to debug possible problems (since the DSL can be debugged, in contrast to reflective approaches). Moreover, we honour existing .edit plugins, and this makes it easy to incrementally/partially migrate an existing EMF project to EMF Parsley.</p>\n<p>In this presentation you will see how easy is to get UI components out of an EMF model and also how to quickly customize it with the DSL.<br />\nIn addition you will see the new features of EMF Parsley that allows you to reuse the automatically generated parts to build a web and mobile applications.<br />\nIn fact, although EMF Parsley is ready for the web since its origins, thanks to RAP integration, in this talk you will see how to use it also with other web technologies like GWT or AngularJS, as well as with Eclipse mobile projects like Andmore (native Android) and Thym (hybrid mobile).</p>\n<p>EMF Parsley is an Eclipse Modeling project, currently in incubation state, with frequent releases, and is already used in business applications.<br />\nIts APIs are becoming stable and we plan the 1.0 release before the end of the year. </p>",

  "abstract": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-3f1f62b6-e617-42fc-39f5-692ebd845d74\">Modern domain-specific modeling environments offer rich graphical editors, which provide multiple views to highlight specific aspects of the design, in order to manage complexity. Such views may capture taxonomy or containment hierarchies, as well as interconnections of the system under design, and offer advanced navigation and traceability means to highlight a selected element in different related views. Within Eclipse, the Sirius project provides an easy way to define such graphical modeling environments.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, similarly to database views, it is a challenging problem to maintain graphical views when the source model changes, either by the user or by automated tool services. This is especially true when working with large and complex Sirius diagrams. However, there is help on the horizon: EMF-IncQuery, the state-of-the-art live model query engine of the Eclipse ecosystem avoids the recalculation of views from scratch after each individual source model change, and provides blazing fast reaction times even for very large diagrams. This talk introduces an extension to Sirius that combines the advanced visualization features of Sirius with the power of live model search provided by EMF-IncQuery to define automatically synchronized views.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The highlights of the talk are:</p>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">IncQueries for interpreted expressions: We demonstrate how we integrated the IncQuery query language into Sirius to provide an alternative high-performance interpreted expression language besides the built-in AQL. As a novelty, our approach supports automatic diagram updates by change impact analysis by initiating a refresh only when a change in the source model affects an element in the view.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Live abstractions: We highlight how easy it is to define additional non-persisted derived views based on a combination of a Sirius diagram definition and a set of queries on your original model. Such live abstractions can provide a significant boost to the usability of your modeling tool, by giving the user the ability to create abstract or compact and automatically updated graphical views of their models, without Java coding. </p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Scalability: Finally, we present an initial scalability measurement to demonstrate how our query-driven views can scale up to industrial size models (the \u201cone million model element\u201d challenge) within a cyber-physical system context.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p dir=\"ltr\">This work is being developed in collaboration between IncQuery Labs Ltd. and the Fault Tolerant Systems Research Group of the Budapest University Technology and Economics (BUTE).

It is still one of the best ways to handle and analyze numerical data today. While Python is for science, Java is for Eclipse but in industry there is a need for an optimal way to exchange data between the two.</p>\n<p>This talks looks at various ways Java and Python can be integrated to give interoperability between Java, Eclipse based tools and Python modules. We look at the full spectrum of integration options, from loosely coupling tools to tight two way integration which involves technology such as PyDev, Jython, AnalysisRPC and Py4J.</p>\n<p>Each type of technology has a particular sweet spot depending on the trade-offs of your application. This talk also takes a look at the Eclipse Dawnsci project which utilizes a combination of these technologies to provide a powerful environment at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron which seamlessly integrates Python and Java. The talk will feature various demos the scientists use such as the ability to perform operations in Python but visualize the results in Eclipse and code-completion of Java classes in a python console.</p>\n<p>This talk was first delivered at Eclipsecon France, and following on from that we will look at the work done since to evaluate the EASE project as the potential Eclipse home to integrate the various Python technologies. </p>",

  "abstract": "<p>There is already a broad spectrum of smart home products supporting their users in many ways in their everyday life. However there are also many products that can be categorized as \"gadgets\" that users quickly forget after the initial enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>Security at home and reduction of energy consumption and costs are among the most requested features for smart home systems. Being honest, available products don't really fulfill this promise, since the acquisition cost can't be amortized for many years. Additionally users need to be technical experts in using and customizing the system.</p>\n<p>Germany is heavily investing in the so called \"Energiewende\", which aims to use as much as possible renewable energy sources and less from traditional power plants. However, the energy network has not been designed for this. ProSyst, the peak lab. together with the German utility EWE and many other partners collaborate to make the \"Energiewende\" a reality as part of a research initiative called \"enera\" with a total budget of 200 million \u20ac. This requires to connect all components in grid from power plants, windmills, up to smart meters and smart home systems.</p>\n<p>Smart home systems are key for the success as they build a direct interface between consumers and utilities. Data collected from the grid needs to be analyzed with Big Data technologies to e.g. understand how and where in the network the energy consumption can be optimized. This data can be used to build new business models that will help to motivate users to directly participate in the realization of the \"Energiewende\". </p>\n<p>The project is going to use OSGi-technology to build a non-discrimenatory smart home ecosystem that is also open for the participation of startups and small medium enterprises offering a big variety of smart home / smart energy related services providing new exciting interfaces and user experience. We are going to present the challenges for building such a complex and connected environment as well as the role of OSGi for the realization. </p>",

  "abstract": "<p>Can a test tool have more than one personality? Can a new alter ego develop over time? It turns out, yes!</p>\n<p>One of the most salient features of working with Jubula is that tests are created via drag and drop from a library of pre-defined actions. While knowledge about testing and a certain technical affinity / capability to structure and model is required, programming knowledge is not. Jubula\u2019s main target group is teams with members who don\u2019t program \u2013 to ensure that test automation is something that the whole team (especially those who best understand testing) can work on. </p>\n<p>The question has frequently been asked though: isn\u2019t there a way to write tests in Java using the mature Jubula remote control code? We\u2019re pleased to announce that the answer is now yes. </p>\n<p>And so we introduce Mr Hyde \u2013 the Jubula API. He\u2019s not actually evil, but he is definitely a new and exciting personality for Jubula. This talk will present participants with both aspects of Jubula\u2019s personality:<br />\n-\tDr Jekyll: writing tests with the Jubula actions in the ITE<br />\n-\tMr Hyde: writing Jubula tests in Java</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll show how the steps to start AUTs, write tests and perform test execution can be done using both aspects of Jubula and talk about how Jekyll and Hyde can fit into your team. </p>\n<p>We gave this talk at EclipseCon NA 2015, and it received good feedback.

The focus of the tool is on improving communication about and through testing, and on providing up to date quality information throughout the development process. It does this in three main ways:</p>\n<ul><li>Tests aren\u2019t written in program code, so they are accessible and writable by anyone on the team (even, and especially, members who are not software engineers).</li>\n<li>Tests aren\u2019t written by recording actions and replaying them, since this leads to redundancies, a great deal of effort, and also means that testing can only begin when the feature is completely implemented.</li>\n<li>There\u2019s plenty of support for writing good, stable and robust tests by using reusable modules, separation of data and objects from the test workflow, intelligent checks and error handling.</li>\n</ul><p>Basically, if you want to test that your use cases are actually doable \u2013 in the same way that the users will work with your software \u2013 but you don\u2019t want to test all your use cases manually, then you should come along to find out more.</p>\n<p>This talk will take you on a journey through the \"what is Jubula\u201c via the \"how does it work\u201d to a demonstration of the tool including how it plays well with continuous integration and application lifecycle management tools.

If you need to handle data that you can put on a map, then LocationTech would be a good place to look for open source solutions.</p>\n<p>There's a growing need to processes large volumes of geospatial data in order to answer questions like:<br />\n - what is the average predicted temperature of Germany from 2050 - 2099 based on certain forecasting models?<br />\n - What are the most common origins of flights that have landed in Stuttgart in the past 15 years?<br />\n - How many tweets containing the hashtag #eclipsecon were sent from European countries?<br />\nEach of these questions have two common elements: location and big data.</p>\n<p>LocationTech projects like GeoTrellis, GeoWave, GeoMesa, and GeoJinni (sense a pattern?) were created to solve this type of problem: how do we ask big data questions concerning location? In this talk, I will give an introduction to those projects at LocationTech that aim to help developers work with big geospatial data, and talk about how those projects approach distributed processing geospatial data at scae. I'll talk about the current state of big geospatial data processing at LocationTech, and where we're heading towards in the future. This talk should be of interest to anyone who wants to learn more about big data processing frameworks such as Spark, Hadoop and Accumulo, learn more about geospatial data and location-based applications, and/or learn about the collaborative efforts of a successful working group inside the Eclipse Foundation, LocationTech.</p>",

After a very short introduction we will do a live demonstration of the following steps:</p>\n<p>- Defining the underlying data entity<br />\n- Creating a form-based UI for all simple attributes<br />\n- Adding tables for referenced entities<br />\n- Layout the UI<br />\n- Adding data and input validation<br />\n- Adding visibility conditions<br />\n- Embedding the form into a running application</p>\n<p>Although this sounds like a lot to cover in 30 minutes, we are confident, we can \u201cMake it happen\u201d. We designed the talk such that even an audience without any EMF experience will be able to follow.

Many of these experiments involve spatial mapping, done by scanning the X-ray beam across the sample while collecting data from a variety of detectors. The Mapping Project aims to unify the way this spatial mapping is done across all of the beamlines, providing big improvements in efficiency and speed along with a consistent user interface and lower maintenance requirements.</p>\n<p>This talk will focus on the new user interfaces for mapping that we have developed in our two Eclipse RCP applications, GDA (used for experimental control and data acquisition) and DAWN (used for data analysis). These interfaces provide a flexible, generalised way to run and visualise mapping experiments in many different contexts, allowing even novice users to access powerful mapping and data processing capabilities in a simple way. Behind the scenes, these interfaces are built on the Eclipse platform using a range of technologies, including the Rich Beans framework, dynamically-generated GUIs and declarative OSGi services.</p>\n<p>In parallel to the mapping project, Diamond Light Source are developing an isosurface visualization viewer for the DAWNSci Eclipse project. This viewer uses JavaFX to create really useful transparent surfaces for viewing scientific data. We will show early screenshots, highlight future work and show you how to reuse the tool inside your own product.</p>",

  "abstract": "<p>The Eclipse Marketplace concept fits well in the world of modularized and customizable applications. Apple has a marketplace, Google has a marketplace and many others too. Hence, the Eclipse Marketplace is a great addition for the Eclipse ecosystem. Moreover, it enables to setup a <strong>well designed patch and update strategy </strong>[1] for both community-driven as well as commercial RCP applications. But as soon as one needs a more <strong>fine-grained control</strong> of the plugins offered in the marketplace, an own solution is inevitable. An <strong>own marketplace</strong> allows you to control the set of offered plugins. Furthermore, you can then decide which plugins shall be delivered depending on the requesting RCP application. It gives you the control needed in a commercial environment, especially if the user shall be restricted to install well tested plugins only.</p>\n<p>Thus the question is: <strong>How to implement such an own marketplace?</strong></p>\n<p>Principally, several XML files are delivered by the marketplace server containing additional information as for example the plugin description and its update site. Hence, any technology can be used to create such a marketplace server which is capable to write well formed XML files. I took the combination PHP/MySQL [2] as both technologies are commonly available in hosted environments. But instead of showing you specific PHP/MySQL functions, I'll give an overview which <strong>steps are necessary to create an own marketplace server</strong> and how to connect it to an <strong>RCP application </strong>independently of the used technology. After this session, you will have a well understanding of the marketplace principles. It is then an easy step to start an own marketplace server.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2014/session/release-patch-update-strategy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2014/session/release-patch-update-strategy</a></p>\n<p>[2] <a href=\"https://marketplace.openchrom.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://marketplace.openchrom.net</a></p>",

  "title": "openETCS - Eclipse in the Rail Domain",
  "abstract": "<p>Eclipse is used in many domains, and the rail domain is the latest addition. The <a href=\"https://itea3.org/project/openetcs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">ITEA2 project openETCS</a> was launched in 2012 and aims to provide an Eclipse-based tool for developing the on-board controllers for trains (amongst other things). The main objective of the project is to improve interoperability of equipment from various manufacturers, and to ensure long-term support of tools and system model. The project will conclude by the end of this year: Join this talk to learn about the <a href=\"http://openetcs.org/tool/\" rel=\"nofollow\">openETCS tool</a>, the results of this project, and how it will continued in the future.</p>\n<p>The European Train Control System (ETCS) is a signalling and control system, designed to replace the many incompatible systems currently used by European railways. It is a central element that allows international high-speed railway lines. But even though trains like the Thalys cross countries on a regular basis, broad implementation of ETCS lags behind, for various reasons. Amongst other things, the ETCS specification is managed in prose using MS Word which contains ambiguities and inconsistencies, resulting in interoperability problems within various ETCS implementations. To fix this, openETCS aims to create an open model of the ETCS specification. By encouraging manufacturers to use a common system model as the foundation for their controllers, rather than prose, interoperability would improve significantly. Further, this model would use an open and freely available tool, to minimize barriers of entry and to reduce risk with respect to long-term support.</p>\n<p>Eclipse has been chosen as the foundation for this tool. The initial goal was to support all activities for the development of the software component of controllers, according to the V-Model. It quickly became clear that this was overly ambitious, and that the biggest value could be achieved by a better management of the existing ETCS specification and by the creation of a SysML system model.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will present the Eclipse-based <a href=\"http://openetcs.org/tool/\" rel=\"nofollow\">openETCS Extended Tool Construction Set</a> (openETCS), which manages the original Word-based ETCS requirements using the <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/rmf/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eclipse Requirements Modeling Framework (RMF)</a>. For system modeling, the <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eclipse Papyrus</a> component is employed. A number of additional components have been prototyped and/or developed to handle activities like traceability, configuration management, code generation, validation and the like. To ensure that openETCS continues after the project concludes, the openETCS Foundation e.V. has been created as a non-profit, modelled after Eclipse Working Groups.</p>",

We would like to share our experience using a holistic approach to OSGi server side development based on plain Equinox that covers IDE, dependency management, build and integration testing. </p>\n<p>This approach differs from others in that it focuses on getting the average developer on board quickly and involves writing some small (core) parts of the toolchain yourself to put you in the driver\u2019s seat. The only preconditions for this approach are Maven and an m2e plugin for Eclipse to execute Bnd on each incremental build. Our approach is particularly valuable in product-line or platform development.  </p>\n<p>Using essential code snippets and brief live demos we will demonstrate:<br />\n\u2022\tHow to develop your own OSGi launcher<br />\n\u2022\tHow to use the launcher during development (IDE + Maven) and deployment<br />\n\u2022\tHow to use the launcher for JUnit based integration tests<br />\n\u2022\tHow to single source dependency management from the pom.xml: no target platforms, no config.inis, and no manual editing of MANIFEST.MF files (let Bnd do its job)</p>\n<p>In the second part, we will show you how to tackle bad OSGi metadata at runtime using a simple Java DSL.

Effectively, it's either web or rich client. Especially when developing Eclipse rich client applications, it's just desktop. Sure, cool techniques like RAP could be used to exchange SWT by web ready JavaScript libraries. Moreover, e4 enables to use different rendering engines for example JavaFX. But again, it's a either SWT or another UI library decision. So why not using a <strong>combination</strong> of both <strong>SWT for the desktop</strong> and <strong>HTML, JavaScript for the web</strong>? Too complicated. Really? An what if an RCP application already exists? There's a solution too. I'd like to show the steps necessary to <strong>prepare an Eclipse RCP application to be ready for the desktop as well as for the web</strong>.</p>\n<ul><li>Separate model and UI bundles (if not already done)</li>\n<li>Tweak the preferences handling (avoid the \"org.eclipse.jface\" dependency in the model bundle)</li>\n<li>Create a web bundle (servlets) to access your application</li>\n</ul><p>If the RCP application is designed well, it's no problem to re-use the model bundles for the web. Because we rely on OSGi, Eclipse Virgo offers great capabilities to run the model bundles and the servlets to access the applications functionality. Finally, both the RCP and web application can be build using Maven/Tycho without making additional rendering engine modifications. <strong>Hence, a combination of both worlds is not just only possible, it keeps you flexible for decisions in the future.</strong></p>\n<p>I'll give a live demo!</p>",

  "title": "Runtime Specialization - Java has never been so dynamic before",
  "abstract": "<p>Much of software development is about creating <strong>variants</strong> of things that have been done in similar ways before. Typical means to create such variants include inheritance / subtyping, extension points and dependency injection. Unfortunately, all of these approaches require that the original author <strong>anticipated</strong> the desired variation points in his/her module, to enable you to create whatever variant comes to your mind. This means, modules intended for reuse tend to be <strong>bloated with\u00a0 indirections</strong> - just in case someone needs to modify something sometime, and still many interesting adaptations are simply <strong>not possible</strong> due to lack of pre-planning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/objectteams/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Object Teams</strong></a> reverses this situation. Creating unanticipated variants is at the core of this approach. The language OT/J adds three layers of dynamism to Java:</p>\n<ul><li>Your POJOs are empowered to assume different <strong>Roles</strong> during their lifetime. Dynamically attaching a Role object to a base object morphs the object into a variant of itself.</li>\n<li>Roles are grouped into meaningful units, called <strong>Teams</strong>. Teams provide modular ways for controlling which Roles are <em>active</em> at which point in time. This enables your program to react differently in different situations.</li>\n<li>In the Neon release, it will be possible to <strong>add</strong> Role and Team classes even <strong>at runtime</strong>. No need to re-start, simply add those classes to the running applications and immediately your application morphs into a variant of itself.</li>\n</ul><p>With power comes responsibility. Object Teams emphasizes the importance of modularity, transparency and control. Variants are created as modules, variants are clearly visible in the application architecture, and simply deactivating any active Teams puts the application back into its pristine state.</p>\n<p>All this will be demonstrated using the language <a href=\"http://wiki.eclipse.org/OTJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">OT/J</a>, the JDT-based environment <a href=\"http://wiki.eclipse.org/Object_Teams_Development_Tooling\" rel=\"nofollow\">OTDT</a>, and the integration <a href=\"http://wiki.eclipse.org/Category:OTEquinox\" rel=\"nofollow\">OT/Equinox</a>, with a sneak preview of the new runtime adaptation coming up for Neon.</p>",

Industry 4.0, Car-to-X communication, or Smart Homes are just a few current trends. The growing functionality and the concurrent and distributed nature of the applications are a great challenge during development. In order to help engineers deal with the rising complexity, we are developing a formal scenario-based method for specifying the interaction behavior of the components on an inter-component level. Our Eclipse-based tool suite ScenarioTools allows engineers to model scenario specifications textually. Furthermore, the scenarios can be executed and thereby simulated, or they can be formally checked for inconsistencies. We also developed a prototype approach for the execution of the scenarios in a distributed system where the components coordinate via MQTT. In this talk, we introduce our method and tool and demonstrate the distributed execution by a Car-to-X example implemented on Raspberry Pi-based robots.</p>",

  "abstract": "<p>Scripting is widely used to automate software processes. Moreover, scripting is used to facilitate customized solutions, such as developing new features quickly or making workflows easily reproducible. Therefore the focus of this work is to enable a seamless interaction of the script with the OSGi bundles of its surrounding RCP application. To address this, we implemented a Jython support in OpenChrom. Jython, is an alternative Python implementation, became popular during the past years as it runs on the JVM. Although there are decent scripting solutions in the Eclipse ecosystem already available like EASE or the PyDev IDE platform, but one has to expose the methods of an RCP application to use with the script manually. An automated approach would be desirable so that all public methods of the surrounding OSGi bundles are visible and automatically exposed to the Jython script editor. We will show, what obstacles we faced and how we solved them, namely:</p>\n<p>* choosing the right interpreter for scripting from various Python implementations (Jython, Py4J, etc.)</p>\n<p>* evaluating existing solutions such as integrating the EASE scripting engine or the PyDev IDE platform </p>\n<p>* exposing OSGi bundles to the Python world to access the underlying functions on the application</p>\n<p>* integrating a light-weight IDE into the software, with features like coloring, auto completion or importing the classes automatically</p>\n<p>* accessing complex Java classes through command shells such as IPython, which also can also help analyzing and visualizing the results.</p>\n<p>Parallel to the live demo, we will also release the source code of the reference implementation under EPL.</p>",

  "abstract": "<p>EMF Compare is a framework supporting model differencing and merging for EMF-based models. Therefore, it enables users to determine changes they have applied to their models, to identify overlaps between distinct models and to merge changes that have been performed on the same model by different users in parallel.</p>\n<p>However, in many modeling projects, the modeling languages and tools for showing and editing models are tailored to the specific needs of the targeted users. Typical customizations range from domain-specific model editing UIs, such as diagrams or form-based UIs, to modeling macros that allow users to make many model changes with one click. If you apply EMF Compare in such customized modeling environments as is, the results cannot and will not be satisfactory out-of-the-box. EMF Compare is and can only be an extensible framework rather than a one-size-fits-all tool.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we show you how you can add tailor-made model comparison capabilities to your modeling project by customizing and integrating EMF Compare in various ways. We explain the extension mechanisms based on examples from customizations that we have actually developed for Papyrus UML and domain-specific form-based modeling projects.</p>",

  "abstract": "<p>One common method of determining the exact structure of thin films is to put them into a beam of neutrons and see how the neutrons reflect off the surface. Such experiments require significant time and effort at one of a handful of facilities around the world since highly-collimated neutron beams are not generally available at local hardware stores. Simulating the profile of the reflected neutrons can thus greatly accelerate the research by providing insight on the best cases to study and keeping the final experiment focused and efficient.</p>\n<p>This talk describes a brand new neutron reflectivity simulator implemented as part of the Eclipse Integrated Computational Environment (ICE) and all the cruel and unusual punishment required to port it from a Visual Basic-laden Excel spreadsheet to the Rich Client Platform (RCP). In particular, it focuses on the new development required to provide Excel-like features in ICE that either preserve the user experience or introduce a new, more powerful capability that only Eclipse could provide. This talk will show the enhancements under the hood that included using GlazedLists to setup generic Material types and improving project support. It will also show enhancements in the ICE workbench including the integration of Nattable for Excel-like tables, enhancements to our visualization tools and SWT-XY-GRAPH for plotting results and inputs, and integrating the Eclipse Advanced Scripting Environment (EASE) to provide Python and Javascript support for programmatically editing table values.</p>\n<p>This is a beginner level talk that will give attendees a good understanding of some of the scientific capabilities available in Eclipse and how many, seemingly unrelated Eclipse projects and other tools can be integrated in new ways to do amazing things. Attendees will also be given a live demonstration of the tool and provided resources for future reference and engagement. Presentation materials will be provided in advance at <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/ice\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.eclipse.org/ice</a>.</p>",

Our decision to adopt e(fx)clipse as our IDE and platform has been instrumental in minimizing the pain inherent in the switch from Swing or SWT to JavaFX.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I'll give an overview of our experiences over the past year developing an e4 + JavaFX rich client application with e(fx)clipse. I'll address some of the problems we've faced, for example:</p>\n<ul><li>SceneBuilder not correctly handling images and internationalized strings in an OSGi context</li>\n<li>setting up a local (mirrored) target platform</li>\n<li>default renderer behavior that did not meet the needs of our application</li>\n</ul><p>and how we overcame these problems. Finally, I'll demonstrate a few differences between the old web UI and the new JavaFX one.</p>\n<p>This talk should be useful for any person who is considering using JavaFX in combination with the e4 platform.</p>",

Many UI features like content assist, syntax highlighting or outline creation are no longer tied to Eclipse. Whether you have colleagues who insist on using IntelliJ or domain experts who want to edit their business rules in the browser, Xtext has you covered now. Our command line ninjas get some love, too: The vastly improved Gradle integration now sports incremental compilation for all Xtext languages.</p>\n<p>The core framework also learned some new tricks, making it even easier to implement complex languages. We streamlined the support for whitespace sensitive languages like Python or highly ambiguous ones like JavaScript and Swift. Oh and did we mention hundreds of bug fixes, new and improved APIs and increased performance?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an exciting time to be an Xtext user, so come and join our session for a look into the future!</p>",

  "abstract": "<p>This talk will aim to dissect the life-cycle of a very important link in the chain of the contribution process at Eclipse - the gerrit review. It will also give tips on how to use at best this really nice tool that is now the de-facto way of making a change to most Eclipse projects. In no way will it be in an \"I'm the expert of Gerrit\" fashion but rather in the \"I'm a guy who already hit all the bumps in road\" mode.</p>\n<p>A gerrit review is usually born out of a mixture of frustration with a bug and a well-intended desire to help. The potential end of it though is quite more colorful:<br />\n- It can be accepted and merged into the code repository with the beloved +2.<br />\n- It can be given a +1 which basically means \"I eye-balled it and it looks nice. No time to thoroughly test and verify it though\".<br />\n- It can be demolished with a -2.<br />\n- It can be left to become a fossil and by the time someone comes to brush the dust out of it, the author is not around anymore.<br />\n- It can enter the spiral of '-1 please adjust this -&gt; Adjusted -&gt; -1 that's not what I meant' which out of frustration can easily become a death spiral.<br />\n- It can be abandoned by the submitter.<br />\n- Even our automated friend Hudson has a veto, and if he says -1 and the build fails none of the above apply. The best thing about Hudson is that he never complains.</p>\n<p>In my path from a plain user to a committer in two Eclipse projects I have personal experiences with almost all of the above-mentioned cases which I will use to illustrate and give hints on how to address them. Usually I have observed that clear communication is a very important component in making a gerrit as successful and less painful as possible.</p>\n<p>I will attempt to give attendees a sincere and open talk on how to maximize the chances of a successful gerrit review and try to address most of the behavioral and technical issues one can face in this process. Only the Gerrit phase of the contribution will be covered so  little-to-no attention will be given to the rest of the process (filing bugs, etc.).</p>",

  "abstract": "<p>One of the most critical aspects in the initial adoption and sustained use of any piece of software is the usability of its interface. Software usability testing allows developers to address this aspect and improve the quality of their product from the user\u2019s perspective through objective and subjective measures collected directly from the user in planned experiments. The analysis of usability test results produces empirical measures of the usability of a given software product. Even though formal software usability testing is frequently done in industry, the results are seldom published[1]. This scarcity of publications is even more pronounced in the open source software community[2]. The lack of open discussion about usability testing begs for an answer to the questions, \u201cHow does one do usability testing?\u201d and, \u201cHow can I apply this approach to my Eclipse product?\u201d</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will present the Eclipse ICE team\u2019s experience in planning and executing usability testing to help shape their software development process. The talk will cover the team\u2019s usability testing journey through all stages of the process starting with initial study design and planning through results analysis and conclusions to help shape future development. The software and hardware tools used to monitor study participants\u2019 interactions, such as mouse movement and key strokes, with the ICE team\u2019s RCP-based application will be discussed. Additionally, the tools used to aid in the analysis and presentation of the data collected in the study will be covered.</p>\n<p>Attendees can expect to leave this session with an insight into how the ICE team implemented formal usability testing to influence their software development practices along with an understanding of the tools and techniques that helped lead to success in their first usability testing experience.</p>\n<p>[1] Seffah, Ahmed, and Eduard Metzker. \"The obstacles and myths of usability and software engineering.\" Communications of the ACM 47.12 (2004): 71-76.<br />\n[2] Nichols, David, and Michael Twidale. \"The usability of open source software.\" First Monday 8.1 (2003).</p>",

  "abstract": "<p>The IoT Expert Group is the newest Expert Group in the OSGi Alliance, but what exactly is an Expert Group, and what does it do? What does that mean for OSGi as an IoT platform?</p>\n<p>This talk from the chair of the IoT Expert Group will cover the progress of the IoT Expert Group since its creation in July, what outputs we can expect to see in the future, and also information about how you can get involved with the Expert Group.</p>\n<p>The OSGi service platform has existed as a modular micro-service runtime for well over a decade, and it was originally created to run on small embedded systems in the home. It turns out that the same model works very well on servers and in the cloud, making OSGi the perfect platform for end-to-end IoT development.</p>\n<p>In the last twelve months the OSGi Alliance have been on an IoT requirements gathering mission, the result of which has been the new IoT Expert Group. Fresh from their first official meeting in Turin the IoT Expert Group is now ready to start the process of building new standards within the Alliance. If you're interested in getting involved, or just curious about what's going on, then come along to find out more.</p>",

But before we are able to answer how much we should test, we must first know how much we are testing.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I am going to report the surprising findings of a large-scale case study on the state of developer testing, facilitated by the purpose-built Eclipse plugin WatchDog. The open-ended case study launched after last year\u2019s EclipseCon and has involved more than 1,500 software developers to date, resulting in over 15 years of recorded and analyzed work time in the IDE. </p>\n<p>Our findings question several commonly shared assumptions about testing and might be contributing factors to the observed bug proneness of software in practice: the majority of developers in our study does not test; developers rarely run their tests in the IDE; Test-Driven Development (TDD) is not widely practiced; and, last but not least, software developers only spend a quarter of their work time engineering tests, whereas they think they test half of their time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.testroots.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.testroots.org</a></p>",

  "title": "Your first Application based on Eclipse - FAQ",
  "abstract": "<p>The Eclipse Platform is a mature and powerful framework for building tools and applications . The modular architecture and hundreds of open source frameworks available for use can significantly reduce the cost of an implementation project. However, Eclipse is also known to add new and sometimes complex concepts to the standard Java world, which might not be known from the start. This can lead to some frustration, non-optimal architectural decisions and therefore some unnecessary additional effort.<br />\nFrom our experience in various Eclipse-based projects, we observe a number of frequently recurring questions and issues. Some examples for these questions are:</p>\n<p>- What are OSGi, bundles and features?<br />\n- Should we use Eclipse 3.x vs e4?<br />\n- How should we split and configure bundles?<br />\n- Why and how to use a target platform?<br />\n- Which OSGi features are important for our project?<br />\n- How can we set up a build?<br />\n- Which additional technologies to use?</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will highlight the most important issues to consider and pitfalls to avoid. 30 minutes are certainly not enough to cover all these critical issues in detail, our goal is to give an overview of the frequently asked questions and create an awareness for the most common issues. We will provide some blueprint solutions, guidelines, and initial pointers for where to get more information and how to address them in detail. </p>\n<p>Slides: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aQbGRLdypojKzyINmYQrLF9Q5jw_Y6PzLvDQjPmG2N4/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aQbGRLdypojKzyINmYQrLF9Q5jw_Y6Pz...</a></p>",
