    "abstract": "<p>Eclipse Xtend is an emerging, object oriented language on the JVM that encourages functional programming and comes with state of the art IDE support for Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA. This session is going to show how Xtend is applied in 10 practical use cases. We will focus on common Java idioms and the integration with popular Java APIs like Android, JavaFX and more.</p>\n<p>You will see how literally any given Java library is even easier to be used and consumed from Xtend than from Java itself. That’s what we call Java-Interop! Xtend code is more concise and readable due to greatly improved signal to noise ratio. Even the simplest tasks become a breeze and powerful language features like the superior annotation processing infrastructure help to automate repetitive coding styles. At the same time all language features are carefully designed to leverage known Java concepts. Java developers get productive in a couple of hours. Xtend will not force you into an entirely new ecosystem but complements Java and allows to stick to all your beloved libraries and tools.</p>\n<p>Join this session and learn how to write cleaner code against any Java APIs and how to solve day-to-day challenges in much better ways.</p>",

At least that's what we hear at conferences, it's what we are experiencing at hackathons and that's why we use the technology at Bosch as well. The approach usually taken involves custom implementation of the full stack from scratch, including device connectivity &amp; management, sensor data processing and business logic. This approach works well for individual applications, usually having limited requirements regarding number of connected devices and scalability. </p>\n<p>In this talk I will introduce you to a generic, cloud based IoT architecture blueprint created in the Eclipse IoT Working Group and the community's ongoing work to evolve the excellent technology created in the Eclipse IoT projects into the IoT Server Platform: a set of ready-to-run, re-usable service components supporting the implementation of micro-service based, cloud-scale IoT solutions on top of popular technologies like Cloud Foundry and Docker.</p>\n<p>Last but not least I would also like to do a demo of the showcase application we have created as proof-of-concept for the IoT Server Platform, provide an outlook on next steps and show you how you can help to make the IoT Server Platform a reality.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Eclipse Platform boasts a rich set of tools for customizing the workbench. While the tools make it easy to add functionality, what if a savvy user wants to customize a single existing widget or even just a single existing widget for a single plugin? Such a savvy user should should at most only be required to provide the code for their new widget and the context in which it should be drawn. This may seem like an odd scenario when one considers the Platform from the perspective of an IDE, but as the Eclipse Platform continues to expand into a broader set of application the need to \"simply tweak\" the workbench becomes more pressing.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce users to the new fine-grained UI extensions API in the Eclipse Integrated Computational Environment (ICE) and its many applications. It will explain the origins of the idea from something to appease a bunch of (possibly rabid) scientists to a more general-purpose capability. ICE's data structures and their coupling to these extensions will be presented as well as the system's tight integration with Eclipse Forms. Concrete examples of non-traditional widgets for neutron scattering, nuclear energy, astrophysics and other areas will be presented using JavaFX and Eclipse technologies such as SWT-XY-Graph, NatTable and the Graphical Editing Framework. Future work to support classes from EMF and to integrate with e4 without the compatibility layer will also be discussed.</p>\n<p>Attendees should have a decent knowledge of how to add extensions to Eclipse, including knowing something of Eclipse 3.x and 4.x as well as a decent amount of Java. Attendees can expect to see some very cool ways in which the Eclipse workbench can be extended with only a minor amount of new code. Information on the critical role of Facebook Open Academy students in this effort will also be presented. Slides will be uploaded in advance of the presentation.  </p>",

In this talk, I will introduce the open standard LoRaWAN: the wide area network protocol stack built on top of LoRa, maintained by telecom operators, chipmakers and other industry leaders.</p>\n<p>With a $ 1.200 gateway in our hands, we imagined covering our city Amsterdam with only ten gateways. Four weeks later, we crowd sourced the gateways and launched the first open LoRa covered city network in the world. The open source, open hardware initiative, The Things Network, spread like wildfire around the world. After a very successful Kickstarter campaign to enable producing affordable gateways, development kits and nodes, we started building the network with the community. LoRaWAN is at the core of this network, and in this talk I'll explain its role in our mission to build an open, decentralized and crowd sourced internet of things data network with global coverage.</p>",

In the second part, we will introduce EMF databinding support as well as demonstrate how to bind data entities to UI controls. In the third part, we will move on to the implementation of a more complex form-based UI including controls for different data types, input validation, and layouting. All parts consist of a technical introduction in addition to hands-on exercises.<br />\nA basic understanding of EMF, SWT and JFace is beneficial for this tutorial.

We will introduce the “Boot Dashboard”, a new open-source piece of the Spring Tool Suite (for Eclipse) that serves as something like a microservice development center right within your IDE. Doing live demos we show how the boot dashboard allows you to deal with potentially many small microservice projects at the same time, how to deploy them to a cloud runtime like Cloud Foundry, how to shorten development cycles for cloud applications using the boot devtools and how to debug cloud-native applications in mixed cloud/local development environments - all right from within your IDE.

Updating the software for an entire car may differ from updating the firmware of a single sensor with regard to the connectivity of the device to the cloud and also to the complexity of the software package update process on the device. </p>\n<p>However, the process of rolling out the software, e.g. uploading an artifact to the repository, assigning it to eligible devices, managing the roll out campaign for a large number of devices, orchestrating content delivery networks to distribute the package, monitoring and reporting the progress of the roll-out and last but not least requirements regarding security and reliability are quite similar.</p>\n<p>Eclipse hawkBit can do all of this for you! This talk is about the project and the capabilities it brings to the table and how you can leverage them in your IoT projects.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Broadway is, along with X and Wayland, a drawing backend provided by GTK UI toolkit. The special thing about Broadway is that it draws on the browser using HTML5 and websockets. This means that you can run your Eclipse/RCP/SWT application and have it rendered not as desktop application but in the browser with Broadway thus allowing fully transparent networking.</p>\n<p>It is important to notice that, since this functionality is provided below the SWT level, no change is required to your application code. Set a couple of environment variables to tell GTK to use Broadway, ensure that broadway deamon is running and you are ready to go. The application should be run on Linux (SWT limitation), but once running you can of course access it from any OS which has a supported browser (works also with some Android phone browsers).</p>\n<p>The talk will make a brief introduction to the origin of the work, how it came to be and how it profits all software running the latest versions of GTK. After that we'll see a couple of SWT examples and how they run on the browser. Next we'll run a full blown Eclipse IDE on Broadway and do some basic interaction with it.</p>\n<p>Lastly we will summarize the challenges faced, the amount and nature of work that it takes to stabilize into a very reliable state and discuss where can we go from there.</p>",

The brilliance of the original architects to build Eclipse as an IDE for everything and nothing in particular provides a showcase for Eclipse as the IDE for IoT.</p>\n<p>This talk will show how the Eclipse IDE can be used to build an IoT application that includes an ESP8266 wifi microcontroller running Arduino to report the value of a sensor and to change the colour of some LEDs. The ESP is wirelessly connected to an edge unit running on a BeagleBone with a Qt C++ application showing controls and status on a touch screen. The edge unit reports the values and receives commands from the AWS IoT platform where rules engine stores the results in a database. An analytics engine then runs against that database and sends commands to the devices based on those results. A web application shows all the action in both a Web browser and an Android app.</p>\n<p>All of these components are developed from a single Eclipse workspace and highlights Eclipse's C++ support for Arduino and Qt programming as well as Java support for the AWS IoT rules, analytics engine and web app server and finally Eclipse's web tools support for the web front end and Android programming environment through the Andmore project for the Android app. No other environment brings this all together to empower the IoT developer to build such great things.</p>",

Although other tools provide alternative graphical and textual representations, the tree-based editor is still valuable and widely-used.<br />\nHowever, the Ecore Editor hasn’t evolved much over the last 10 years. The same is true for the generated editor, which allows one to create instances of an arbitrary data model.<br />\nIn this talk, we will demonstrate a new version of the standard Ecore Editor, which is currently under active development. It aims to provide an improved usability and and efficiency when specifying data models in EMF. It features handy shortcuts for frequent operations and specialized controls.<br />\nAdditionally, we demonstrate a replacement for the generated editor for model instances, which is more extensible and adaptable than the existing one (granted, it was not built for these purposes). Finally we will show a making of, explain technical details of the implementation, as well as the frameworks used.</p>\n<p>Comment: This is refined version of the talk given at EclipseCon Europe 2015, which was well attended and had excellent feedback. As the development is on-going, we will present new features of the editor, based on the community feedback.</p>",

Care has been taken to make the EDC a proper subset of the different Java runtime environments found in Android, J2SE, J2ME, OSGi Minimum and others.</p>\n<p>This talk aims at presenting the packages and API that constitute the core of EDC, defining the minimal foundation that iot.eclipse.org projects can rely on, and still compatible with economical constraints of the IoT: footprint.</p>\n<p>The Edje project also defines a standard high-level Java API called Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for accessing hardware features delivered by microcontrollers such as GPIO, DAC, ADC, PWM, etc. that can directly connect to native libraries, drivers and board support packages provided by silicon vendors with their evaluation kits.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Edje also aims at providing ready-to-use hardware and software packages that developers can get and use to develop quickly and easily IoT device software and applications, possibly from application stores.</p>",

A renderer is responsible for producing an actual UI from a form definition. EMFForms ships with excellent tooling to create forms and with industrial-strength renderers for SWT and RAP. There are also incubator implementations for rendering forms based on JavaFX, iOS, Android and Vaadin.<br />\nSince more and more applications are now implemented on a native web stack (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript) in contrast to RAP and Vaadin, EMFForms now also supports rendering forms with AngularJS.<br />\nIn this talk we will provide an introduction to the basics of EMFForms and the concept of UI modeling. We will then demonstrate how this can be used in the context of an AngularJS-based web application using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, JSON and JSON Schema.</p>\n<p>Comment for PC: This is a revised version of a talk on EclipseCon Europe 2015 which received excellent feedback (14 x +1, 0 x 0, 0 x -1)</p>",

Xbase is statically typed and supports full type checking and type inference. It comes with a compiler and interpreter and integrates seamlessly with all existing Java APIs - it does so even better than Java itself!</p>\n<p>Join this hands-on lab and you will learn about the possibilities that come with Xbase. In only 3 hours, you will develop a full-blown language live and from scratch!

    "abstract": "<p>Science relies on the ability to explain natural occurrences in a <em>reproducible</em> way. This reproducibility is a fundamental part of the scientific method, and is essential for ensuring that the experimental design is correct and that any subjective bias has been eliminated. A high level of transparency, and the ability to independently verify research, is critical for establishing the dependability of the results. As extremely powerful computer systems have become cheaper and more accessible, scientific research is increasingly being performed using modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) rather than (or in conjunction with) experimentation in real life. In some fields, such as engineering, M&amp;S is now the accepted method for research and development. Unfortunately, the widespread adoption of M&amp;S is leading to a reduction in the level of transparency necessary for acceptable scientific research. In addition to requiring specialized hardware and software, a particular simulation might require a complex workflow involving an ensemble of applications, hand-crafted input data, and a significant amount of post-processing and analysis to produce usable results. Current tools make it very difficult to capture the exact environment and precise workflow necessary to reproduce complex simulations such as these.</p>\n<p>The field of simulation lifecycle management (SLM) is emerging as a unified approach for the control of simulations and associated test data in a manner that promotes transparency and collaboration. Although there have been some efforts to converge on a set of tools and methods for SLM across scientific disciplines, these approaches are still ad-hoc and difficult to scale. Eclipse is an ideal platform for addressing the needs of SLM, and projects such as the Eclipse Integrated Computational Environment (ICE) and the Data Analysis Workbench (DAWNSci) are attempting to solve many of these problems.</p>\n<p>This talk will provide an introduction to SLM, and show how it can address many of the issues facing scientist undertaking M&amp;S-based research. We will then take a dive into some of the specific features of these projects to show how Eclipse is positioned to become the cornerstone platform for managing M&amp;S across the entire scientific research community.</p>",

Users of MDHT modeling tools are often clinical informatics specialists, not familar with UML or software engineering. MDHT must enable these users to edit and review clinical information models with terminology value set constraints, while remaining focused on the clinical content and not overwhelmed by model formalisms. MDHT includes specialized editing tools for using healthcare terminology systems such as SNOMED CT or LOINC, and transforms these models with terminology bindings to runtime Java libraries that enable application developers to serialize/deserialize instance data and test compliance with all constraints specified in the UML models.</p>\n<p>Several real-world implemented examples built with MDHT will be described in this presentation, including UML models and generated runtime Java libraries for current healthcare interoperability standards that are maintained by the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC).

    "abstract": "<p>Eclipse is an awesome IDE, but setting up your application's dependencies to run locally... sucks.  The \"browser-based\" Eclipse makes it easy to develop in the cloud, but only if you forgo the rich features of your desktop IDE.  Why can't we have the best of both worlds?  Turns out, we can!  This talk investigates the principles of the CDT/PTP (what works well and what works not-so-well), and applies the lessons learned to create a cloud-capable build of eclipse which we use for editing general Java &amp; Web Applications.  Users run a full-featured local IDE, but their entire workspace lives in the cloud, making cloud development a first-class citizen in the Eclipse IDE.  We investigate the details of our caching, prefetching, and lazy loading, which allow nearly all operations to occur at local-filesystem speeds.  We investigate the clever use of Eclipse's API hooks to further improve the performance of time-sensitive operations.  We then demonstrate the other benefits of developing on a remote environment - like being able to do distributed builds, distributed unit testing, managed infrastructure/configuration/dependency upgrades, etc.  Ultimately, we conclude by open sourcing what we believe is the perfect development environment for anyone who hates dealing with local configuration/environment issues and just wants to write code!</p>",

Today it is a widespread language across industry and academia, however mostly it is still applied with commercial closed-source tools. In contrast to those tools Papyrus finally offers a comprehensive and extensible open-source software solution for UML.  </p>\n<p>In this talk let's take a 35 minutes trip back to our childhood with Papyrus4Lego. First, we will discover how simple it is to learn modeling UML with Papyrus. Second we will show you how we built a customized Lego DSL on top of Papyrus including customized tooling.<br />\nIf you are a user of UML, a tool smith, intend to build a modeling tool or if you just want to take a trip back to your Lego childhood, this session is definitely for you. </p>",

    "abstract": "<p>With over 40 billion devices estimated to be deployed and connected to the Internet by 2020, managing the configuration of the device remote  endpoint can be challenging.</p>\n<p>Today, most devices are shipped with hard coded hostname or IP address of their gateway or cloud service. However, this model will not effectively scale to support a dynamic market deploying billions of devices.</p>\n<p>The Tiaki Eclipse Project (<a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/tiaki/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.eclipse.org/tiaki/</a>) addresses this problem by enabling any connected device to securely discover the platforms and services with which it should communicate. By implementing the IETF DNS-SD RFC 6763 (DNS-based Service Discovery) for Java and C, Eclipse Tiaki offers a standard-based library for devices to configure themselves dynamically, thus reducing the device management overhead and offering an increased flexibility for platforms and services providers.</p>\n<p>Eclipse Kura, the open source Java/OSGi-based framework for IoT gateway (<a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/kura/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.eclipse.org/kura/</a>), is leveraging the Secure Service Discovery to dynamically discover its available Cloud Services, such as MQTT brokers, overcoming the need for hard-coded configuration. Through DNS-SD, Eclipse Kura benefits from a globally distributed, resilient, always-on infrastructure that securely hosts its services information without the need for a dedicated cloud.</p>\n<p>In this session, we will elaborate on the benefits of using DNS-based Secure Service Discovery for your devices and gateways as compared to traditional device configuration. We will then take you on a simple, step-by-step journey to enable your Eclipse Kura gateways to leverage on the DNS infrastructure using Tiaki.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>EMF in combination with EMF Forms promises to drastically reduce the effort for building form-based UIs for data entities. However, articles, blogs, and slide can lie. The goal of this talk is to give a real impression of how these technologies perform in practice. We will therefore skip boring slides and theoretical explanations and dive directly into the development of a single form. After a very short introduction we will do a live demonstration of the following steps:</p>\n<p>- Defining the underlying data entity<br />\n- Creating a form-based UI for all simple attributes<br />\n- Adding tables for referenced entities<br />\n- Layout the UI<br />\n- Adding data and input validation<br />\n- Adding visibility conditions<br />\n- Embedding the form into a running application</p>\n<p>Although this sounds like a lot to cover in 30 minutes, we are confident, we can “Make it happen”. We designed the talk such that even an audience without any EMF experience will be able to follow. We will provide all code examples of the talk as well as pointers to detailed explanations to dive into the topic more in detail for interested attendees.</p>\n<p>Comment for PC: This is a revised version of a talk on EclipseCon Europe 2015 which received very good feedback (10 x +1, 1 x 0, 0 x -1)</p>",

We have entertainment at our finger tips, connection to our social networks and access to any and all information. However, these very capabilities make these devices vulnerable to tampering, often without physical contact. Their interconnectedness, allowing them to form “clusters,” enables hackers to create “botnets” of infected devices that cause mischief, inconvenience and even physical risks to users.  Attackers and smart device malware often look for vulnerabilities to gain root access on the device. Using this access, attackers could target communications, location data, install more malware, or steal sensitive and confidential information. Additionally, it can replicate itself, moving from one device to another, eventually compromising a cluster of connected devices and exploiting interactions between them.  The widespread use of ‘cracked’ apps represents a real and present danger given the explosion of smartphone and tablet use in the workplace and home.</p>\n<p>Do you have a good security program today?

With EMF, models can be defined very quickly and instances of the created models can be created and stored by the users (e.g., in XML files). The problem that will inevitably arise over time is that these models will at some point need to be changed. And this is where things get ugly. What about the model instances your users already have? Do they still conform to your new model? How can you migrate them to the new model? How can you automate creating these migrators?<br />\nEdapt is tackling this problem by recording the changes on the model and generating migrators for model instances. In practice whenever you change your Ecore a history file is created and with Edapt tooling, you can generate a migrator plugin. This migrator plugin can be used at runtime to migrate your model instances from the old model version to the new model version.<br />\nIn this presentation, we will describe the basic features of Edapt and demonstrate how it can be used for migrating your models.</p>",

To us modeling people it looked like a very good fit for DSL’s (Domain Specific Languages), hence suitable for an experiment : let’s build  specific modeling tools for smart farming systems!</p>\n<p>This experiment represents a few days of work bringing open-source technologies together: EMF, Xtext, Sirius, Gemoc (a model debugging environment, including specific features for concurrency constraints), OptaPlanner (a constraint satisfaction solver from the JBoss community) and Acceleo, resulting in a collection of Eclipse based tools for farming systems <a href=\"https://github.com/gemoc/farmingmodeling\" rel=\"nofollow\">(published on github)</a>. Just like in The Avengers, each technology bring its own capability but it is the amalgamation of all of them which lead to amazing power!</p>\n<p>The session will start with a demo of the Smart Farming System Tooling, an environment to model, analyze and simulate an agricultural exploitation, biomass growth and water consumption based on user input and open data.  Then we will dig deeper in how the technologies are mixed and used, among other questions: which of the textual or graphical syntax is better suited for a given aspect? how can we achieve a “perfect blend” of those syntaxes? how OptaPlanner and EMF can create a powerful synergy?  how data from INRA can be structured and fed into the tool?</p>\n<p>The talk will then evaluate how useful open-source technologies are in addressing this class of problems and how modeling can be used to support sustainability, enable broader engagement of the community, and facilitate more informed decision-making.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Diamond Light Source is the UK national synchrotron, a machine that generates powerful beams of xrays used by scientists for a wide variety of experiments. In one of those experiments, a certain technique called Photo Emission Electron Microscopy (PEEM) is used to provide spectroscopic information of samples on a nm scale. PEEM proves useful in different fields of physics, chemistry, material science or life science. Samples investigated can range from meteorite pieces to biologic tissues and magnetic materials.</p>\n<p>To help with the visualisation and analysis of such data, an Eclipse RCP perspective named PEEMA has been developed and made available within the DAWN Eclipse RCP workbench. </p>\n<p>The purpose of this talk is to present how generic OSGI services from the DAWNSci Eclipse project - for data loading, processing, plotting and persistence - are used to help scientists visualize and analyse their data. The talk will tackle in particular the usage of the FOSS Java Computer Vision library BoofCV used in PEEMA through OSGI services to perform advanced image processing such as image registration and stitching. In addition, the talk will show the new Eclipse Rich Beans project and how it is used in the PEEMA perspective to provide scientists with widgets that satisfy their needs.</p>",

With the continued growth of open source software, the time is right to bring out new, open source tooling that takes advantage of up-to-date standards and modern modeling technologies and infractructure.</p>\n<p>With its extensive support to define and implement domain specific modelling languages based on UML and its built-in implementations of standard UML profiles such as SysML and MARTE, Eclipse's Papyrus project, also a PolarSys solution, offers an ideal base on which to build such a tool.</p>\n<p>Based on this, Papyrus for Real Time offers a UML for Real Time model-based development environment that enables its users to create models that fully and correctly generate code for complex embedded applications. Papyrus for Real time includes a customizable runtime service layer that abstracts and adapts to the underlying targeted hardware platform.</p>\n<p>This session shows, though presentation and demos, how the new Papyrus for Real Time Eclipse project provides these features to address the needs of the CPS community through its user interface, code generator, and runtime services, from system engineering to executing a standalone application.</p>\n<p>Finally, we will present our vision for current and future work such as support for other \"real-time\" modelling approaches, performance, multicore support, tracing and debugging, multi-platform support, and model-based testing.</p>\n<p>If you are system or software architect or designer working on reactive systems in CPS, embedded or other domains that wants to understand how executable modelling can help you, then this session is for you!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Eclipse Integrated Computational Environment (ICE) is an IDE for scientists that lowers the barrier to entry for complex research codes by providing standardized methods of interaction.  ICE's plugin-based architecture makes it straightforward to integrate new software packages, however, there is still a learning curve for new users who may be unfamiliar with Eclipse's plugin architecture or the finer points of Java.</p>\n<p>In order to further reduce the barrier to entry for scientific computing we have developed plugins that allow a user to create simulation models, job launchers, and data visualizations with a minimal amount of knowledge of Eclipse, ICE, and Java.  These plugins feature new wizards, code generation tools, and abstracts the need to manage plugin infrastructure.  We have also eliminated most of the tedium associated with writing file parsers by providing a smart parser generator.  By simply filling out a specialized form users can generate both reader and writer classes that are ready to be integrated into ICE's IO service.  We are extending this form based parser generation tool to include machine learning algorithms that can be pointed to a set of training data and automatically extract file features and structures.</p>\n<p>Prior to the development of these tools the integration of a new research code into ICE could take several weeks.  With the new process this time has been cut down to an afternoon. In this talk we will provide an overview of the steps that are required to create a new plugin and load it into an installation of ICE.</p>\n<p>This talk will focus on the technical details associated with automating development of Eclipse plugins.  Attendees will learn how to build ICE items using the tools we have developed as well the tools required to automate the generation of custom Eclipse project types.

    "abstract": "<p>Advanced modeling and simulation is revolutionizing the way we do science. It provides a means to test, predict, visualize, and analyze complex physical phenomena in a controlled manner that inevitably directs future theoretical and experimental endeavors. This truth is recognized by the scientific community, with much effort being directed at the development of advanced software frameworks to streamline the way we do computational science research. These frameworks begin to mask some of the complexity of scientific computing, however they don’t go far enough to enable accessibility to the average domain scientist, whose classical training is likely not in computer science or software engineering. </p>\n<p>One such framework is the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE). This framework enables the rapid development of scientific simulations that are based on the finite element method. MOOSE is extensible in a large array of its sub-systems - it is extremely easy to inject new physics, boundary conditions, material properties, and analysis tools into the framework for use in your MOOSE-based application. Despite this, it is still an involved process to develop MOOSE code, execute that code on a massively parallel high performance computing machine, and visualize and analyze the results. It can take months of arduous work. This talk attempts to answer the question - Can we streamline MOOSE development and use even further with Eclipse?</p>\n<p>This talk will describe recent plugins implemented for the Eclipse Integrated Computational Environment (ICE) to streamline and improve the entire MOOSE development workflow - from MOOSE application development to execution on a remote HPC resource. This talk will demonstrate how the Eclipse platform and the infrastructure built into ICE can take this arduous scientific computing task (that usually takes months!) down to a mere 10 minutes. </p>\n<p>This is a beginner level talk and attendees will leave with a good understanding of the architecture and inner-workings of both MOOSE and ICE. Attendees will see the power of the Eclipse platform through the reusability of a myriad of existing popular Eclipse technologies such as CDT, EGit, and PTP. </p>",

With EMF Compare users can determine changes they have applied to their models, identify overlaps between distinct models and merge changes that have been performed on the same model by different users in parallel.<br />\nHowever, in many modeling projects, the modeling languages and tools for showing and editing models are tailored to the specific needs of the targeted users. In some modeling projects, models are edited in a diagramming editor, others may use a form-based or table-based UI for editing models. Also custom behavior in modeling editors that make users more efficient in the model editing process is no exception in real-life modeling projects.<br />\nIf you apply EMF Compare to such modeling projects as is, the results can not and will not be satisfactory out-of-the-box. EMF Compare is and can only be a model comparison framework rather than a one-size-fits-all tool. Therefore it is very flexible and highly customizable and can be tailored to the specific needs of your modeling language/model.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we show you how you can add tailor-made model comparison capabilities to your modeling project by customizing and integrating EMF Compare in various ways.

The goal of Triquetrum is to support a wide range of use cases, ranging from automated processes based on predefined models, to replaying ad-hoc research workflows recorded from a user's actions in a scientific workbench UI. It will allow to define and execute models from personal pipelines with a few steps to massive models with thousands of elements.</p>\n<p>Triquetrum uses the actor model, where actors read inputs, make local decisions and write outputs.  Actor models are inherently concurrent, where as object-oriented systems are typically executed sequentially (though often with a threading system added on).  The execution semantics of an actor is called the model of computation.  There are many different models of computation including discrete event, finite state machines, continuous time and synchronous dataflow.  The Triquetrum system gives the user the ability to hierarchically compose workflows using different models of computation and to get deterministic results.    Workflows have been used by systems like Kepler and Taverna to support data provenance and reproducibility for experiments that use large data sets. </p>\n<p>Triquetrum consists of three workstreams.  The first is moving the Ptolemy actor execution engine into OSGi bundles and providing an RCP GUI.  The second is providing APIs and OSGI service implementations for Task-based processing, which will be independent of Ptolemy.  The third is developing APIs and tools for external software packages, resource managers and data sources.</p>\n<p>We will discuss how Triquetrum will be used or is already used in Science Working Group projects, including Eclipse ICE and DAWNSci.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>MQTT is a protocol used for connecting small devices to a server and hence to each other.  It has been around since 1998, when its inventors imagined a few thousand devices would be connected to one server.  Now that MQTT is becoming a prominent protocol used for the Internet of Things, solutions with millions of devices are being proposed.  I will talk about how MQTT might be used to build such solutions.</p>\n<p>We can build large scale IoT solutions with MQTT using edge of network gateways and brokers such as Eclipse Kura and Eclipse Mosquitto as well as the client libraries of Eclipse Paho, connecting to cloud services such as those from IBM, Eurotech, Microsoft and Amazon.  The simplest model is to connect every individual device to the cloud service.  But MQTT allows components to be built up out of smaller building blocks, each component having an aggregate behaviour which can then be used to build larger components.  At each level the MQTT traffic can be analyzed, filtered and aggregated so that the consuming components are not overwhelmed.   Such an MQTT network is self-similar or fractal, greatly increasing its potential scale.  </p>\n<p>I will also consider how we might manage and secure devices in such topologies, and use gateways to allow the solution to include devices using other protocols, such as Modbus, Bluetooth, ZigBee or MQTT-SN, </p>\n<p>.</p>",

    "title": "What every Java developer should know about AngularJS ",
    "abstract": "<p>Many business applications nowadays have a least some web UI parts using server-side rendered, static HTML. With the upcome of dynamic HTML Javascript frameworks like Ember.js or backbone.js, there is a continuous trend to implement those web front-ends as “single page” applications. While there is a lot of diversity in the JavaScript world, one framework has become especially popular for business applications, that is AngularJS. It allows to extend HTML by dynamic behaviour and provides essential concepts for developing single page web applications.<br />\nIn this tutorial, we introduce AngularJS from scratch for Eclipse/Java developers. Based on an example application, we explain the basic concepts such as directives, controllers and dependency injection - using terms and concepts from the Eclipse/Java ecosystem. Iteratively, we will apply our learnings in hands-on exercises. In addition we will discuss which of the available Eclipse-based Tooling is best suited for working with a JS stack.<br />\nOur target audience are explicitly Java and Eclipse developers with no or very limited previous experience with JavaScript, TypeScript and AngularJS. While 3 hours are certainly not enough to become experts on AngularJS, our goal is rather to provide a good overview and basic understanding. </p>",

Existing hardware simulation tools allow developers to test if their code is functionally correct on a specific device. Unfortunately, this type of simulation alone falls short when integrating the code into more complex applications or libraries, or when simulating hardware sensors or components that have custom interfaces.</p>\n<p>An alternative approach is to allow for simulation of hardware at the software API layer, where the specifics of the hardware implementation are already abstracted out into higher-level functions. An example of this would be simulating an i2c temperature sensor with a simple getTemperature() function, rather than reading individual bytes from a simulated i2c bus.</p>\n<p>Learn how we have integrated this approach into our development tools, and how this has been successful for developing IoT projects using our Kinoma Create hardware and JavaScript runtime.</p>",

Command line ninjas get some love, too: The vastly improved Gradle integration now sports incremental compilation for all Xtext languages.</p>\n<p>The core framework also learned some new tricks, making it even easier to implement complex languages. We streamlined the support for whitespace sensitive languages like Python or highly ambiguous ones like JavaScript and Swift.

This can lead to some frustration, non-optimal architectural decisions and therefore some unnecessary additional effort.<br />\nFrom our experience in various Eclipse-based projects, we observe a number of frequently recurring questions and issues. Some examples for these questions are:</p>\n<p>- What are OSGi, bundles and features?<br />\n- Should we use Eclipse 3.x vs e4?<br />\n- How should we split and configure bundles?<br />\n- Why and how to use a target platform?<br />\n- Which OSGi features are important for our project?<br />\n- How can we set up a build?<br />\n- Which additional technologies to use?</p>\n<p>Which additional technologies to use?<br />\nIn this talk, we will highlight the most important issues to consider and pitfalls to avoid, as well as,the most interesting frameworks to investigate. 35 minutes are certainly not enough to cover all these critical issues in detail, our goal is to give an overview of the frequently asked questions and create an awareness for the most common issues.
